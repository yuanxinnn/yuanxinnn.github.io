Hi! Iâ€™m a 2nd-year Ph.D. student majoring in computer science at [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/). I am fortunately advised by [Prof. Nong Xiao](https://cse.sysu.edu.cn/content/2484). Prior to that, I received my Bachelor degree in computer science from the School of Computer Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University. Currently, I work as a research intern at Alibaba Cloud PAI Group from July 2024.
